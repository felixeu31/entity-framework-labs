Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'dbo.TableName' with unique index 'IX_TableName_ColumnName'. The duplicate key value is (guid).

The operation failed: The relationship could not be changed because one or more of the foreign-key properties is non-nullable. When a change is made to a relationship, the related foreign-key property is set to a null value. If the foreign-key does not support null values, a new relationship must be defined, the foreign-key property must be assigned another non-null value, or the unrelated object must be deleted.
